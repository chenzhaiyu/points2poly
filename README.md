# Points2Poly

-----------

## Introduction

**Points2Poly** is the implementation of the compact building surface reconstruction method described in this [arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13142). This implementation incorporates learnable implicit surface representation into explicitly constructed geometry.

Due to clutter concerns, **the core module is separately maintained in the [abspy](https://github.com/chenzhaiyu/abspy) repository** (also available as a [PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/abspy/)), while this repository acts as a wrapper with additional sources and instructions in particular for building reconstruction. **The wrapper code is being cleaned.**

## Requirements

The requirements consist of two parts: one from `abspy` that provides functionalities on vertex group, cell complex, and adjacency graph; the other one from `points2surf` that facilitates occupancy estimation.

### Requirements from `abspy` 

Follow this [instruction](https://github.com/chenzhaiyu/abspy#installation) to install `abspy` with its appendencies.

###  Requirements from `points2surf`

Init `points2surf` submodule:
```bash
git submodule init
```

Install the requirements listed in `points2surf/requirements.txt` with PyPI:

```bash
pip install -r points2surf/requirements.txt
```

For training the neural network, make sure CUDA is available and enabled.
You can navigate to the [points2surf](https://github.com/ErlerPhilipp/points2surf) repository for more details on its requirements.

## TODOs

- [x] Separate `abspy`/`points2surf` from `points2poly` wrappers
- [ ] Config with hydra
- [ ] Tutorial on how to get started
- [ ] Host generated data
